Game Description:
It will be  a survival and building game set in a 3D world. The main goal is to gather blocks from different places and use them to build and protect the player’s base. The base can be any shape the player wants but the player must protect the main core.
The game has two main phases: building and attacking. In the building phase, the player can explore the map, collect scattered blocks, and place them in the base. Players can also take back blocks they have already placed and use them somewhere else if you need to fix a weak spot.
When the attack phase starts, two enemies will appear in random spots and start moving toward the base. They will try to break the player's blocks and also shoot at the player. If the player gets hit several times and loses all of his/her life levels, the game will end. To survive, the player can move around to dodge their attacks or fight back by shooting at them until they are destroyed.
Even while the enemies are attacking, can keep building or fixing his/her base. This gives  more chances to protect his base and survive longer. After the player destroys the enemies, the player will have a short break to gather more blocks and prepare for the next wave.
The waves keep coming, and the enemies become harder to fight as time goes on. The game ends if the base’s core is destroyed or the player loses all their life levels. The challenge is to balance collecting blocks, building strong defenses, and fighting enemies all at once to survive for as long as possible.
